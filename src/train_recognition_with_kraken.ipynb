    "# Train HTR recognition models with Kraken\n",

    "This notebook assumes the following folder structure: `data` for ground truth, `mod` for saving the models gained through training, and `src` containing this notebook and potential base models.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are basically two ways of training HTR modells with Kraken: You can train a model *from scratch* or *fine-tune* a pre-trained model. Fine-tuning a modell to your specific needs is more ressource-efficient. It will go faster and you can achieve good results with a relatively small amount of ground truth. Training a modell from scratch requires more effort but your modell will be well fit to your data. This notebook will take you through both of these options, make sure you only follow the sections needed for your project.\n",
