# Train HTR models in Kraken
## Description
The Jupyter notebooks in this repository contain instructions for comand line-based training of HTR models in Kraken. They offer a way to use the Kraken engine without a GUI-based platform such as eScriptorium and are meant to offer a simple, easy acces to comand line training.
The comands are used in current DH projects in the *Regesta Imperii - Regesta of Emperor Frederik III* (*Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities*).
All notebooks in this repository are designed (but not limited to) be used in *Google Colab*.

## Contents
Currently this repository contains separate notebooks for training recognition and segmentation models in Kraken.

## Instructions
*to be updated*

## Notice
The code and notebooks within this repository are being developed on the go and thus subject to change at any point. Upon completion this repository may be retired and made available through other platforms such as *zenodo*.
